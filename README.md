# SkipCut Leap &nbsp;🚀

Open any YouTube video in a fresh SkipCut tab—instantly skipping the ads.  
Works from the right-click menu **or** with a handy _Ctrl + left-click_ shortcut.

## Features

- **Context-menu action** – “Open in SkipCut” appears whenever you right-click a YouTube link.  
- **Keyboard shortcut** – Hold **Ctrl** (Cmd ⌘ on macOS) and left-click a link to jump straight to SkipCut.  
- **No background polling** – the extension does nothing until you interact with a YouTube link, so it’s lightweight and private.
